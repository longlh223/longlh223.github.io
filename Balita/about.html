            <h2>About Travelling</h2>
            <img src="Travel.png" alt="Du lịch thế giới" >
            <p>Travelling may mean many things for many people. If we open up dictionaries, they give many meanings of travelling. Someone may be on a trip or journey. For another group, travelling may mean going from one place to another as a travel agent, salesman, for business purpose, or studies. Light also travels from one object to another. Again, in some games like basketball, breaking a certain rule may mean travelling.</p>
            <p>However if we take all the definitions of travelling, they are all directly or indirectly related to learning. All these activities make us come into contact with human beings, places and experiences. But there may be some travelling which are specifically for learning purposes. The most popular of them are related to students and researchers. In today’s systematic learning process the Arab saying “Seek knowledge even as far as China” is much suitable. Travelling automatically suits here as process of learning. It is the literal movement from one place to another than watch television to acquire knowledge. Journeys shown in television and internet videos still seem quite metaphorical. When we travel, we literally collect valuable facts about those places. The Chinese proverb also stresses upon travelling saying that “Traveling ten thousand miles is equivalent to reading ten thousand books". The visual, auditory and sensory gets engaged in travelling. We also get emotionally engaged when we literally travel for knowledge and learning. And when we share back our travelling-experiences then our own creativity gets explored too. It is a holistic and wholesome exercise.</p>
            <p>Some travel permanently. That is part of migration which has been a common phenomenon ever since ages. They may settle in another place forever. Greater cities like London and other cities of Europe and North America have been known for having settlers from all over the world. They have become boiling pots of mixed cultures, religions and languages. Some work outside their root-places or abroad where they may spend a major part of their lives. This also helps them learn and pick new ways of life. Sometimes they pick new cultural habits and languages which become part of their lives too.</p>
            <p>Travelling in Groups or families</p>
            <p>Travelling can be approached in various ways. Most of the time students and researchers travel in groups or with their families. Common interests are involved in such group-travelling. Travelling is part of adult-education. In most of the countries it has been made compulsory in their educational institutions. It has become part of the trans-world education. When kids travel, they learn how to read maps, estimate mileage, calculate gas mileage and read road signs. Travelling has become part of contemporary modern lives. Some of the ancient and famous travelers were Huen Tsang and Ibn Batuta from Asia. However, compared to ancient ways of travelling, today it is more secure and faster. Today’s travelling is more sophisticated unlike early travelers who mostly travelled via foot. Today science has made travelling so easy, swift and so comfortable. Sometimes families travel to the kins inside their countries and abroad. This personally benefits them to see and know new lands and make new acquaintances. The family also remains united despite far away from each other.</p>
